# Big Blue Button Autostatus

School is war.
With homeschooling and video conferences students are at an advantage—an advantage that should not come to waste.

The **Big Blue Button Autostatus Firefox Extension** gives you many special capabilities:

### Direct Status Change

Use the **extension popup** to select your status in the video conference.
Therefore you don't have to click yourself through two menus just to put on a smile.

You can open the **extension popup** by clicking on the extension icon in the top right of the task bar.

### Status Go Brrrrrrrrr

Did you ever miss being able to snap your finger in online class?
The option _Status Go Brrrrrrrrr_ automatically cycles your status, changing it up to ten times per second.
This allows you to annoy the hell out of everyone—including your teacher.
Just imagine the chaos this would cause if everyone would use it...

### Anti AFK Detection

Does this sound familiar to you?
_"Everyone who understood this, please change your status to 'Thumbs Up'"_
If the only thing your teacher expects you to do is to occasionally change your status, this feature may be your saviour.

This—still experimental—Feature looks at all the other students, determines the most popular status, and selects it for yourself.
Enjoy some time for yourself while your teacher wastes their time talking about Romanticism or something.

It can be activated in the **extension popup**.

When the anti afk detection is online, you shouldn't use the normal interface for changing your status.
Any changed status will be **overwritten** by an online anti afk detection.

To disable the anti afk detection, you only have to select any status in the **extension popup**.

### Disabled Statuses for the Anti AFK Detection

But what if the teacher asked a question and for some reason almost all students raise their hand.
In that case the anti AFK detection would raise your hand as well, putting you at risk of being selected by the teacher.
This could lead to the detection of your absence.

To fix this issue you can set certain statuses to be ignored by the anti AFK detection.
For this you have to access the **settings** of the extension.
Simply click the _Open Settings_ Button in the **extension popup**.
There you will find one checkbox for each status.
All of the checked checkboxes are treated as if none of the other users chose that status.

### Toggle Raise Hand Shortcut

Do you want to save some time raising and lowering your hand?
Just go to the settings fo the extension and select a shortcut you like.
You have to make sure that the shortcut isn't used by any other part of the browser or your operating system.
Just try a few different shortcuts and determine which ones work for you.

When you've selected a shortcut you like, click part of your browser and type your shortcut.
You status will automatically toggle between _None_ and _Raised Hand_.

How about that, pretty easy, isn't it?
